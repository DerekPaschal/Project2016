TODO:
- Multithread the drawing and game update loops
- Design main menu screens
- Design JSON file reading system to automatically load game configurations
	* Could be very useful for organizing saved game states, menus, etc.
	* Would allow for some changes to be made to the game at runtime without recompile
	* Possible future uses:
		- Path to resources folder for ResourceLoader class read by file rather than hardcoded
- Create core code for shooting projectiles from ships (Done, will be merged in build soon)
- Design a sample level to showcase core functionality of the game
- Add pausing function to the main game loop
- Ability to toggle specific verbose debugging (to System.out)
- Determine how specific sprites (such as ships, asteroids, buttons) know where to request their image
- Move ActionButton set position according to reference point to Sprite class
- Add class to contain GUI elements ingame?
- Allow ActionButton text to scale with the image?
	* Fix ActionButton text centering code
